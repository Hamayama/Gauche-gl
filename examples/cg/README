This directory contains a couple of examples ported from NVidia's
Cg distribution.    Porting is done by Issac Trotts.
The original program is copyrighted by NVidia Corporation.
See the source for the complete notice.

A shell script `run' is included to run the demos conveniently.
After building Gauche-gl with --enable-cg, try:

  ./run checkered-sphere-cg.scm
